=begin

Line 34 raises TypeError. It is because `remaining_cards` may contain elements
of the symbol type.

After fixing the TypeError, the sum we get is lower than it should be. It is 
because when we create a `deck` Hash object, the values of all suits are the 
same `card` Array object. Therefore, when a card is poped out from a suit, such 
change is reflected in all other suits, making the sum lower than it should be.
