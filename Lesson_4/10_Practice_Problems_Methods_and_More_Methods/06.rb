p ['ant', 'bear', 'caterpillar'].pop.size

=begin

The code above returns 11.

The pop method destructively removes the last element in the array and reutns
it, which is 'caterpillar'. The size method is then called on the return string
by pop. The size method finds the length of the string and returns it, which is
11, hence the return value of the above code.

=end
